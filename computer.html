         This is listed as a computer project, even though it is a medical information type page. The goal of this project is to learn how to use some javescript functions with an interactive image. To implement on a currently live website for spinal cord injuries. <h2><a href="http://hereandnowproject.org/">Here and Now Project</a></h2><p></p><p></p><p></p>
